      <p>A terms and conditions agreement outlines the website administrator’s rules regarding user behavior and
        provides information about the actions the website administrator can and will perform.
        Creating the best terms and conditions page possible will protect your business from the following:
      <p>
        Essentially, your terms and conditions text is a contract between your website and its users. In the event
        of a legal dispute, arbitrators will look at it to determine whether each party acted within their rights.

      <h1>Are You Legally Required to Have Private Policy</h1>
      <p>Technically, no. You aren’t required to have a terms and conditions agreement.a
        However, having terms and conditions for websites is considered standard business practice in the US,
        Canada,
        the UK, and just about everywhere else — from South Africa to Earth.

        If you plan to grow your business or expand your user base, a simple website terms and conditions page will
        provide your site with an additional layer of legal protection.

          Potential litigation: If a user lodges a legal complaint against your business, showing that they were
          presented with clear terms and conditions before they used your site will help you immensely in court.
